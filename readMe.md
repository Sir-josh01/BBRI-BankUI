## Overview
Overview
The BBRI-BANKUI project is a modern, responsive user interface component designed to present key service options (like "Find a location," "Make an appointment," and "Quick help") in a clear, accessible manner. It uses the Bootstrap framework for styling and layout, ensuring flexibility and mobile-friendliness.

The challenge
To implement a clean, accessible, and responsive bank help/options section using modern front-end techniques and the Bootstrap utility-first class system. The primary goal was to ensure correct HTML structure (fixing issues like redundancy and improper nesting) and establish a clear visual hierarchy for key user actions.

## My process

- Developed structure using semantic HTML and applied Bootstrap utility classes for layout, spacing, and responsiveness.
- Ensured correct nesting for Bootstrap components (e.g., Dropdown) and utilized Flexbox for precise alignment of icons and text.
- Focused on code cleanup and maintaining a modular structure.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- **Bootstrap 5** (for styling, layout, and dropdown components)
- **Bootstrap icons** (for visual elements)

### What I learned

I gained a better understanding of advanced Bootstrap layout techniques, particularly:
* Using `d-flex`, `justify-content-between`, and `align-items-center` for intricate component alignment.
* Correctly structuring complex nested components like the combination of icons and dropdowns.
* The importance of minimizing redundant wrapper divs for a cleaner component structure.

### Continued development

- DOM manipulation (for dynamic content changes, potentially integrating with a framework like React/Vanilla JS)
- Animations (for transition effects on hover or interaction)
- Add a backend with database to make it more dynamic
